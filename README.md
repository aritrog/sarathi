<p style='color:red'>According to sources, nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year, on
average 3,287 deaths a day. An additional 20-50 million are injured or disabled. More than half
of all road traffic deaths occur among young adults ages 15-44. Apart from that, a commuter
on average spends 42 hours stuck in traffic each year, according to CNBC. We sincerely
believe our technology has the potential to cut down these number to almost Nil with
widespread and thorough application, taking safety concerns in considerations. This will help in
increasing efficiency standards of automobiles and the traffic in general.
Given the scenario of innovations in various automated driving systems by Tesla, Waymo, Lyft
etc., what makes our technology a true Innovation is the decentralized structure and itâ€™s
extended outreach because of its independency on the traditional connectivity. While this
project is quite a lot in the conceptual stage yet, it provides a glimpse of what the future
transportation scenario might look like, thanks to the highly advanced computer science. </p>


The main highlight of the said concept, over the persisting technologies, is the extensive use of Swarm Intelligence for a decentralized network of automobiles, communicating and navigating in tandem. The said improvements project towards simplified navigation and mobility system in the absence of any physical signalling systems or manual help. Additional focus is laid on the overall safety thresholds under any given scenario that might arise, through thorough considerations. 
This technology would drastically reduce issues of collisions, traffic congestion, thefts, illegitimate route updates and several other modern-day issues, through a live interconnectivity and updation network. 
The know-how and scope of the implementation of the concept is laid down as shown in the following presentation.
