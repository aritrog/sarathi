The local repository on your laptop or pc where you're cloning the universal repo should only be used to push or pull changes/work done on the project. DO NOT WORK on the local repo folder as it can lead to fatal errors. Create a separate folder elsewhere and make changes there. Use Diffmerge or Meld to merge the changes with the existing files in the local repo. Doubts should be clarified, take care of this strictly.
